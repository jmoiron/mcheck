## mcheck

mcheck is a command line tool for verifying minecraft datapack files against mcdoc schema.

It's also an experiment and autodidactic attempt at using claude code to produce the kind of program that it seems that LLMs are suitable to produce.

Clone https://github.com/SpyglassMC/vanilla-mcdoc into this directory for the `mcheck` tool to have access to the schema.
